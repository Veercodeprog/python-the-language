#operators in python
#operators are special symbols in python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation.
#the value that the operator operates on is called the operand.
#types of operators:
#1. arithmetic operators
#2. comparison operators
#3. logical operators (or, and, not)
#4. bitwise operators(&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>): works on binary numbers. 
#5. assignment operators(=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=, &=, |=, ^=, ~=, <<=, >>=)
#6. membership operators(in, not in)
#membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object.
#7. identity operators(is, is not)
#identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location.

print(a is b)

x="hello"
print("h" in x)
x=[1,2,3,4,5]
print(1 in x)
