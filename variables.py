# type of variables in python
# 1. Numeric: int, float, complex
# Sequence: list, tuple, range
# Text: str
# Mapping: dict
# Set: set, frozenset
# Boolean: bool
# Binary: bytes, bytearray, memoryview


a = 'drungu'
print(a)

# we dont need to define the type of variable in python.so it is dynamically typed language

# and static typed language is where we need to define the type of variable before using it.

# dynamic binding is where the type of variable is determined at runtime.so we can change the type of variable at runtime.
a = 4
print(a)

# static binding is where the type of variable is determined at compile time.so we cannot change the type of variable at runtime.
